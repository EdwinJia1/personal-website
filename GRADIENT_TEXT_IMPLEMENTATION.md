## Design Decisions

### Color Palette
Used the website's existing color scheme:
- Primary: `#7a9088` (sage green)
- Secondary: `#6a8a8e` (blue-gray)
- Creates a smooth, professional gradient that matches the site's aesthetic

### Animation Speed
- Set to 6 seconds for a subtle, elegant animation
- Not too fast (distracting) or too slow (static)
- Provides visual interest without overwhelming content

### Border Setting
- `showBorder={false}` for all implementations
- Creates a cleaner, more modern text effect
- Focuses attention on the gradient text itself
- Better suits the minimalist design of the website

### Responsive Design
- GradientText component uses `max-width: fit-content`
- Automatically adapts to text length
- Works seamlessly with existing responsive layouts

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/GradientText.css` (NEW)
2. ✅ `src/components/cards/PersonalCard.tsx`
3. ✅ `src/app/blog/page.tsx`

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd 01-projects/personal-website
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Navigate through pages:
   - Homepage (/) - Check "Evan Lin" and "Computer Science Student"
   - Blog (/blog) - Check "Blog" title
   - Projects (/projects) - Check "Projects" title
   - About (/about) - Check "About Me" title

4. Verify gradient animation is working smoothly

## Customization Options

If you want to adjust the gradient effect, you can modify these parameters in any component:

```tsx
<GradientText 
  colors={['#7a9088', '#6a8a8e', '#7a9088', '#6a8a8e', '#7a9088']}  // Change colors
  animationSpeed={6}  // Adjust speed (higher = slower)
  showBorder={false}  // Set to true for border effect
>
  Your Text Here
</GradientText>
```

### Suggested Variations

**Faster Animation:**
```tsx
animationSpeed={4}  // More dynamic
```

**Slower Animation:**
```tsx
animationSpeed={10}  // More subtle
```

**Different Colors:**
```tsx
colors={['#40ffaa', '#4079ff', '#40ffaa', '#4079ff', '#40ffaa']}  // Original cyan/blue
```

**With Border Effect:**
```tsx
showBorder={true}  // Adds animated border around text
```

## Browser Compatibility

The gradient text effect uses:
- `background-clip: text` (widely supported)

- CSS animations (universal support)
- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Performance Notes

- Lightweight CSS animation (GPU-accelerated)
- No JavaScript required for animation
- Minimal performance impact
- Smooth 60fps animation on modern devices

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation in your browser
2. Verify all gradient effects are working as expected
3. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
4. Adjust colors/speed if needed to match your preferences
5. Consider adding gradient effects to other key elements if desired

## Support

## üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it `personal-website` (or any name you prefer)
3. Make it **public**
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

### Step 2: Push Your Code

```bash
# Add all files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Personal portfolio website"

# Set up remote repository (replace YourUsername with your actual GitHub username)
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/personal-website.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically run

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

- The first deployment takes 2-5 minutes
- Check the **Actions** tab to see the deployment progress
- Once complete, your site will be live at: `https://YourUsername.github.io/personal-website/`

### Step 5: Future Updates

Every time you push changes to the `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys your site
2. Updates go live in 1-2 minutes
3. No manual intervention required!

## üé® Customization

### Update Your Information

1. **Profile Photo**: Replace `public/profile.jpg` with your photo (same filename)
2. **Personal Details**: Edit your information in:
   - `src/app/page.tsx` (main homepage)
   - `src/app/about/page.tsx` (about page)
3. **Projects**: Update project data in `src/app/projects/page.tsx`
4. **Blog Posts**: Modify posts in `src/app/blog/page.tsx`

### Change Repository Name

If you want a different repository name:
1. Update `basePath` and `assetPrefix` in `next.config.js`
2. Replace `/personal-website` with `/your-repo-name`
